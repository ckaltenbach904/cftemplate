        <h3>My Story</h3>
         <p>My name is Catharina Kaltenbach. I have more than 10 years experience in IT Support, some Database administration and Networking. I work currently at Hughes Network Systems as a NOC operator. I have always been fascinated in web development but have not chance to learn. This year, I really decided to get into Web Development. It took me 6 months to really find the perfect Online school that would fit to my schedule and budget. Hunting for online classes is quite overwhelming as each one is different on what they offer. In addition, I have a few acquaintances who introduce me with web development so it helps me. </p>
      </section><!-- this is a short story about me and how I decided to take Web Development course -->
