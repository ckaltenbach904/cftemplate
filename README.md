This is my webapp while attending Career Foundry! The contact form is not activated as the focus of the web app is to show the front end capability of the webapp which includes HTML5, CSS, Javascript and some JQUERY. Bootstrap is also use to see if the web app is responsive on desktop as well as mobile.
