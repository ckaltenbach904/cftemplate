What is an object literal, and how do you access its properties, including methods?

object literal is the curly braces and it's contents. The object is storeds in a variable called kitten. So you 
can call it kitten object

for ex.

var kitten = {
  color: "orange",
  favFoods: ["turkey", "tuna", "grapes"],
  speak: function() { console.log("meow"); },
  numberPaws: 4
};

kitten.sayHello = function () {
  console.log("Hello! I am an " + this.color + " kitten!")
};

How does the this keyword in JavaScript work?

in the above example, the this keyword is used to tell that is is using color properties is this object.
